welcome to example program in this video

we will see how we can write a program

to check for palindrome now what exactly

is a palindrome a palindrome is a world

or a number or a phrase or other

sequence of characters which reads the

same backward as forward which is

nothing but for example if we have the

string ma ba m-madam then when we

reverse this we get ma da-jung so it

treats the same forward or backward so

it is a palindrome similarly if we have

the number 1 to 1 then when we reverse

it we can I get 1 to 1 so it is a

palindrome ok now how we can write up

within program to check for palindrome

in this video we will ask the user to

enter a string you know he can enter the

number as a string value and then we

will reverse that user input and then we

will see whether that reversed value is

equal to the original value entered by

the user if if it is so then it means

that the value entered by the user is

palindrome else the value entered by the

user is not palindrome so I'm going to

use the input function here and I'm

gonna specify the message as enter the

value okay now after seeing this message

user will enter the whatever the value

he wants to check for palindrome and we

will store that in a variable and let's

call that as yes this input function

will read the user input in string form

and it will return that and we have the

user input in s in string form here the

user can enter the numbers you know one

to one but it will be read as string

value okay

now the next thing that we have to do is

we have to reverse the user input and to

do that we have a lot of techniques

available but in this video I'm going to

use a method called as slicing so what I

want to do is I want to slice this

string here I want to slice the entire

string so I'm not gonna

specify the starting and ending point

because if we don't specify that then it

will take the entire string here and

then I want to specify this step as

minus 1 now this will reverse this

string and we store that in the reverse

variable now here we are using the

slicing method we are not specifying the

starting and ending point here when we

don't specify that it will take the

entire string here this minus one

indicates that we want to step backwards

by 1 so it will reverse the string and

it will return that

and we are storing that in this reverse

variable now the reverse of the user

input is stored in this reverse variable

what we can do is we can check whether

the original value entered by the user

is equal to the reverse of that value if

it is so then it means that the value

entered by the user is palindrome so we

will do that by using the if conditional

statement and we will check if yes is

equal to reverse it means that the value

entered by the user is palindrome we

will use the print function and we will

say yes it is palindrome ok if the

reverse is not equal to the original

value entered by the user then it means

that the value entered by the user is

not palindrome so I'm going to copy this

I'm going to paste it in here and I'm

going to say no it is not palindrome

ok so now we have written the program

here

let's build and run this enter the value

I'm going to enter ma ta M if I hit the

enter button it says yes it is

palindrome ok let's close that let's run

it one more time this time I'm going to

enter one-to-one if I hit the enter

button it says yes it is palindrome

I'm going to run it one more time and

this time I'm going to enter a nil and

it says no

it is not palindrome so this is how you

guys can write a simple Python program
